# AIU Transaction System

This project is basically about loan request and transaction. Users can request for updating balance by requesting to the admin and their balance will be updated once
they are approved by the admin. Users can also request to another users for payment request and they can also make loan transaction right away. Once, any user is requested, the
requested users' account will get notification and it will last there until the requested users respond to it. Requested users can approve the requested amount, negotiate 
the requested amount or they can also deny the request.
